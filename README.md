# plume-sim-risk-flow

`plume-sim-risk-flow` is a C# project for Simulations. It turns create a C# reference implementation for risk workflows, centered on diagnostic reporting, negative fixtures, and human-readable error snapshots into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Plume Sim Risk Flow

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Purpose

This project keeps the domain idea close to the tests. That makes it useful as a reference implementation, a small experiment, or a starting point for a more specialized tool.

## What It Does

- Models input state with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep policy checks changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for fixture data, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents local reports tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Design Sketch

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The C# code keeps the core model in a small static API and runs checks through the executable path.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Setup

Use a normal shell with C# available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Fixture Notes

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `recovery` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Limits

The examples cover useful edges, not every edge. A larger version would add malformed-input tests, richer reports, and deeper domain parsers.

## Next Directions

- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add one more simulations fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
